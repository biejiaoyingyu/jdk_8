/**
 * A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.
 * Implementors define a single method with no arguments called
 * {@code call}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Callable} interface is similar to {@link
 * java.lang.Runnable}, in that both are designed for classes whose
 * instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A
 * {@code Runnable}, however, does not return a result and cannot
 * throw a checked exception.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class contains utility methods to
 * convert from other common forms to {@code Callable} classes.

 * @param <V> the result type of method {@code call}
 *
 *           Callable 也是因为线程池的需要，所以才有了这个接口。它和 Runnable 的区别在于 run() 没有返回值，
 *           而 Callable 的 call() 方法有返回值，同时，如果运行出现异常，call() 方法会抛出异常。
